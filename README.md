# Astronomical-Data-Analysis
These codes were written for the UIUC Astronomical Techniques class. There is a diverse toolset that could be used to analyze astronomical images, make visualizations, and analyze data.  

## 1. Electromagnetic Spectrum
This code generates the following plot of the electromagnetic spectrum.

## 2. Reduced Chi-Squared Test
Code generating Gaussian distribution with 100 samples with mean = 10 and a standard deviation of 2; calculation of Poisson counting error for each bin; calculation of reduced Chi squared test from the central 10 bins at the peak of the distribution. This code generates the following two plots:
